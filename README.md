# TYPO3 Translation Handling Initiative Extension

This repository contains the **TYPO3 Translation Handling Initiative Extension**, a testing tool to easily reproduce translation-handling-related use cases in the latest TYPO3 Core. The extension is inspired by the official [styleguide extension](https://github.com/TYPO3-CMS/styleguide/).

---

## Purpose

The extension provides a quick and reproducible way to set up TYPO3 instances with predefined translation-related test cases. It is intended to support developers and integrators in validating concepts, testing edge cases, and experimenting with translation handling in TYPO3.

---

## Scope

* Generates demo sites and content structures for translation handling
* Provides CLI commands for creating and managing test datasets
* Includes example setups to simulate common and complex scenarios

---

## Target Audience

* TYPO3 Core developers working on translation features
* Extension developers validating multilingual behavior
* Integrators testing translation handling in projects

---

## Contribution

We welcome input from the TYPO3 community:

* Open [issues](https://github.com/t3thi/translation-handling/issues)
* Share real-world use cases
* Join discussions at TYPO3 Camps, DevDays, or Slack huddles

---

## Status

This repository is **work in progress**. It is a playground for experiments and not intended for production use.
